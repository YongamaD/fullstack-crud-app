# Fullstack CRUD App

A production-grade full-stack CRUD application built to demonstrate modern frontend, backend, testing, and delivery practices.

The project intentionally focuses on a simple domain in order to highlight engineering quality, structure, and real-world decision-making rather than feature breadth.

---

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate modern React + TypeScript frontend practices
- Build a clean, well-structured Node.js API
- Use a relational database with migrations
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Scaffold testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Ship with CI/CD and automated quality checks
- Be deployable and runnable in a real environment

This is a **portfolio signal project**, not a production startup.

---

## Non-Goals

- No social features
- No real-time updates
- No complex UI animations
- No payments or external integrations

Restraint is intentional.

---

## Tech Stack (High-Level)

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Testing:** Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright (smoke)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

(Exact choices are documented as the project evolves.)
